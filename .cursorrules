# Development Environment Preferences
- This project does not use Cloudflare tunnels or ngrok
- For local development, use `npm run dev` instead of `shopify app dev`
- Avoid suggesting any commands that create tunnels (cloudflare, ngrok, etc.)
- The development setup is configured to work without tunnel dependencies

# Code Change Guidelines
- ALWAYS ask for permission before making any changes to files
- Explain what changes will be made and why before implementing
- Wait for user confirmation before proceeding with file modifications
- Only make changes after explicit user approval

# Shopify Development Guidelines
- Use Shopify Dev MCP for all Shopify-related questions and development tasks
- Leverage MCP for Polaris Web Components (s-components) guidance, GraphQL queries, and Shopify best practices
- When working with Shopify APIs, webhooks, or app architecture, consult MCP resources
- For UI components, prefer Polaris Web Components (s-page, s-card, s-button, etc.) over React Polaris components
- Use MCP for up-to-date Shopify documentation and examples
- Always use s-components syntax for embedded Shopify apps
